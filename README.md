The program is an NLP autocomplete model. It is trained on the nltk english twitter dataset, so ensure that you have this dataset in the correct folder on your computer.
The program computes n-gram models, and predicts the expected next word given a model. You are free to use this code.


To test out the autocomplete, run main.py with a number of n-grams you want
example: python3 main.py 5

Then, you can input a sentence and see the suggested words

To see how the model works, you can uncomment the tests in autocomplete.py, and run the file, to see how each function works. Tests for each function are commented underneath the function, so simply uncomment those tests to see the output of the function.
